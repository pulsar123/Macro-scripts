# Part of Macro-scripts package (a complete Open Source workflow for processing macro focus stacking photographs)
# Written by Sergey Mashchenko

# Aligning focus stack, starting from the middle frame, and running two processes in parallel in the opposite directions.
# This ensures good framing for the aligned stack (minimizes frame waste) and accelerates the computations by 50-100%.
# Creates a set of aligned images with the names OUT0000.tif, OUT0001.tif and so on.
# If something goes wrong you might need to kill one or both running align_image_stack processes manually using
# pkill or kill.
